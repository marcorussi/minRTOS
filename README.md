# minRTOS
a simple highly configurable task scheduler.

This simple RTOS is perfect for small unpretentious projects. It call lower functions of my timer layer for PIC32.

ATTENTION: since these file have been taken from my PIC32 framework the called tasks are not implemented in these file. Please refer to my PIC32 framework project as an example of use.
